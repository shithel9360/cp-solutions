# CP Solutions

## About
This repository contains a collection of competitive programming problem solutions from various online judges including:
- **Codeforces** - Solutions to problems from contests and practice
- **Leetcode** - Algorithm and data structure problems
- **AtCoder** - Contest problems and solutions
- **Other platforms** - Various competitive programming challenges

## Structure
The repository is organized with problem solutions and algorithm implementations:
- `codeforces.cpp` - C++ template and sample solutions for Codeforces problems
- `leetcode.py` - Python template and sample solutions for Leetcode problems

## Languages
- **C++** - Primary language for competitive programming with fast I/O and STL
- **Python** - For algorithm clarity and rapid prototyping

## Algorithms & Data Structures
This collection includes implementations of common competitive programming topics:
- Sorting and searching algorithms
